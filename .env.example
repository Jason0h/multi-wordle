# General Translation (gt-next) — get keys at dash.generaltranslation.com

# Development (used by `pnpm dev`):
#   Use a dev key (gtx-dev-...). The dev server will hot-reload translations
#   on demand without needing to re-run the translate command.
#
# Production (used by `pnpm build`):
#   Use a production key (gtx-api-...) in your CI/CD environment.
#   The build script runs `npx gtx-cli translate` before `next build` to
#   pre-translate all content. Never expose this key to the browser.
